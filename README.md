Community: [Join the OMPWEB Discord](https://discord.gg/evqgGzRfM5)

A place to work alongside coding agents, built on [oh-my-pi (omp)](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi). Nook reads your local omp session files and provides a browser workspace for conversations, live dictation, model configuration, and project files. The package and terminal command remain `ompweb`; existing settings and session data are unchanged.

## Requirements

- [omp](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) installed and on your `PATH` (or point `OMP_WEB_OMP_BIN` at the binary)
- Node.js 22.19.0 (`nvm use`; `node --version`)

## Quick Start

**Run without installing:**

```bash
npx @kahme247/ompweb@latest
```

**Or install globally:**

```bash
npm install -g @kahme247/ompweb
ompweb
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:30177](http://127.0.0.1:30177). The CLI will try to open the browser automatically after the server is ready. ompweb listens on `127.0.0.1` by default.

**Options:**

```bash
ompweb --port 8080              # custom port
ompweb --hostname 0.0.0.0       # expose on a trusted network
ompweb -p 8080 -H 0.0.0.0       # combine options
ompweb --no-open                # do not open the browser automatically
ompweb --password "a-long-random-password" # password-only sign-in without POSIX inline-env syntax

PORT=8080 ompweb                # environment variable is also supported
OMP_WEB_HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 ompweb # explicit network exposure
OMP_WEB_PASSWORD='a-long-random-password' ompweb # env-variable form (POSIX: inline or exported)
OMP_WEB_NO_OPEN=1 ompweb        # useful when running as a background service

# Windows (PowerShell / CMD)
# $env:OMP_WEB_PASSWORD="a-long-random-password"; ompweb
# or
# ompweb --password "a-long-random-password"
```

Set `OMP_WEB_PASSWORD` (or pass `--password`) to protect the interface and every API endpoint with a themed, password-only sign-in screen. A successful sign-in creates an HTTP-only signed session cookie for 30 days; changing the configured password invalidates existing sessions. Leaving the variable unset disables authentication. Remote use still requires HTTPS through a trusted reverse proxy or VPN so the password and session cookie cannot be intercepted. On Windows the env-variable syntax is `$env:OMP_WEB_PASSWORD="..."`; `ompweb --password "..."` works in every shell without that extra step.

### Security and troubleshooting

- The server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. A non-loopback hostname is an explicit opt-in and should only be used behind a trusted network boundary; ompweb is not safe to expose publicly.
- File APIs are allow-listed to the selected workspace, its valid Git worktrees, session-referenced directories, and explicitly selected roots. Paths are canonicalized to reject traversal and symlink escapes.
- `omp` is resolved from `OMP_WEB_OMP_BIN` first, then `PATH`. If live chat cannot start, run `omp --version` in the same terminal or set `OMP_WEB_OMP_BIN` to the executable's absolute path.
- Session history remains native OMP JSONL. OMP owns live-session writes; ompweb reads the files directly and only performs explicit title, archive, and delete maintenance when it is not racing a live OMP write.
- Session archive uses OMP's native `archive/sessions/<cwd>/<file>.jsonl.gz` layout and moves sibling artifacts with the transcript; the original JSONL bytes are preserved inside the gzip.

## Features

- **Pick work back up**: browse previous omp conversations by project without digging through terminal history or session paths.
- **Try different directions safely**: continue from an earlier message (in-session branches with a branch navigator) or fork a session into a separate route.
- **Keep the sidebar tidy**: archive an inactive session without deleting its native transcript, or delete it explicitly when it is no longer needed.
- **Work across branches**: switch Git worktrees from the sidebar so new sessions and the Explorer follow the checkout you choose.
- **Chat beside the project**: browse files on the left and preview source, docs, images, audio, and PDFs on the right while the agent works.
- **Dictate into the draft**: click the microphone, speak, then click Stop to transcribe with Google Gemini 3.5 Transcribe (smart mode) into the editable draft. The recording arrow instead transcribes and sends or queues the combined draft. Cancel discards only the audio; switching chats cancels pending dictation. Recording stops automatically after five minutes and is limited to 20 MiB. Requires microphone permission and HTTPS (or localhost).
  Failed transcription keeps the recording available for retry or download in the current chat. Retry inserts text into the draft without sending. Download before refreshing, closing the page, or switching chats: recovery is in memory, not persisted.
  Optional live local transcription: set server-only `OMP_WEB_DICTATION_REALTIME_URL` to a compatible realtime WebSocket service. Audio streams over a persistent same-origin WebSocket. Local provider failures fall back to Google using the full recording, with a visible provider indicator. Backgrounding stops capture and finalizes into the draft without sending; the next mic tap requests a fresh stream.
- **A quiet composer**: model and reasoning stay visible as text, the context ring opens usage and compaction controls, and `+` holds attachments and advisor settings. Recording shows a live microphone meter and elapsed timer. On touch devices, Enter inserts a newline; tap the arrow to send. Desktop Enter sends, with Shift+Enter for a newline.
- **Watch subagents and plans live**: composer-attached panels show the todo plan and running subagents with per-subagent telemetry; click a chip for the full subagent transcript.
- **See session state clearly**: context usage, cost, tokens-per-second (reported by omp itself), compaction state and method (with before → after token counts on compaction cards), and system prompt details are visible from the top bar and transcript.
- **Preview markdown faithfully**: YAML frontmatter renders in a summary card (title + key/value rows), math fences stay aligned inside lists, and CJK ranges like `5~7U` are no longer mangled (GFM now requires `~~` for strikethrough).
- **Pick projects naturally on Windows**: a drive picker at the filesystem root and a case-folded, symlink-aware project identity keep the sidebar stable across drives and worktrees.
- **Configure less from the terminal**: manage models, login/API keys, model tests, task agents, native OMP controls (advisor, approval, Bash policy, thinking, compaction, memory, auto-learn, retry/fallback), skills (search, install, update checks), plugins, and project MCP servers from the web UI.
- **MCP management in Settings**: a dedicated MCP tab lists installed project servers with status (enabled / disabled / invalid), supports add/edit/rename/validate/remove, and surfaces configuration failures as corner toasts.
- **Autonomous goals**: `/goal <objective>` starts a server-owned goal that continues after ordinary final replies, even without an open browser tab. The agent calls `finish_goal` with evidence when completed, or a blocker summary when human input is required. `/goal` or `/goal status` shows state; `/goal pause` stops further continuation after the current turn, `/goal resume` restarts it, and `/goal clear` removes it. The existing Stop button pauses the goal and aborts the turn. Goals persist per session; process/server restarts leave them paused until explicitly resumed. There is no implicit token budget: work continues until completion, a blocker, an error, or your pause. Old browser-only goal indicators are not automatically activated—set the objective again.
  You can also tell the agent “set yourself a goal to …”: its `set_goal` tool activates the same persistent loop during the current turn. Agents cannot replace an existing goal or override a pause; use `/goal clear` or `/goal resume` yourself.
- **Slash commands that travel**: `/plan`, `/review`, `/fix`, `/test`, `/explain`, `/simplify`, `/commit`, and `/advisor` expand into well-structured prompts; omp's own commands (skills, `/compact`, …) appear via `available_commands_update`.
- **Keep OMP current**: check the installed runtime version, update it, and restart active sessions from Settings when needed.
- **Stay informed**: opt into browser notifications when an agent finishes, play a completion sound, and check installed skills for updates.
- **Jump anywhere with ⌘K**: a command palette (⌘K / Ctrl+K) for switching sessions, starting new ones, and toggling the theme.
- **Warm, paper-like design**: light and dark themes with serif display type and WCAG AA-verified contrast, built on a token-driven UI kit (Base UI primitives, cmdk, lucide icons).

## Supervised deployment on the Nook host

`npm run deploy` runs the isolated build, candidate checks, rollback arming, and production cutover under a separate systemd user service. It builds releases on `/fs0`, never into live `.next`. Check progress with `npm run deploy:status`; logs are available through the worker unit printed at startup. After confirming the browser reconnects, run `npm run deploy:confirm`. Use `npm run deploy:rollback` to restore the previous release. The independent rollback fires after ten minutes unless confirmed. Host paths/service/health URLs can be overridden with `--config <json-file>`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PORT` | Server port (default `30177`; `-p/--port` wins) |
| `OMP_WEB_HOSTNAME` | Bind hostname (default `127.0.0.1`; `-H/--hostname` wins) |
| `OMP_WEB_PASSWORD` / `--password` | Password for the sign-in screen; `--password` works in every shell (PowerShell/CMD) without ` $env:` syntax |
| `OMP_WEB_NO_OPEN` | Set to `1`/`true` to skip auto-opening the browser |
| `OMP_WEB_OMP_BIN` | Absolute path to the `omp` binary when it is not on `PATH` |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | Point at another omp agent directory (default `~/.omp/agent`) |
| `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` | Standard proxy variables for server-side requests |
| `OMP_WEB_GEMINI_API_KEY_PATH` | Google dictation key file (default `~/.omp/agent/discord-gemini-api-key`, shared with the Discord integration; mode `0600`) |
| `OMP_WEB_SSH_TARGETS` | JSON array of configured SSH targets: `id`, `name`, `destination`, absolute remote `cwd`, and optional `ompBin` |
| `OMP_WEB_REMOTE_SESSIONS_PATH` | Remote session descriptor registry (default `~/.omp/agent/remote-sessions.json`) |

Configure dictation with the Discord integration's `/discord transcribe login`, or place your Gemini API key in the file above with owner-only permissions. The browser sends recorded audio to ompweb; only the server reads the key and contacts Google. Transcription requests use `store: false`, and the server attempts to delete the uploaded Google audio file afterward. Cancelling an upload cannot retract audio already sent to Google.

Configured SSH workspaces appear beside local workspaces in the sidebar, with hostname and platform badges; their conversations use the main chat pane and shared composer. Configure `OMP_WEB_SSH_TARGETS`, for example `[{"id":"malphite","name":"Mac","destination":"amos@malphite.vxn.rs","cwd":"/Users/amos","ompBin":"/Users/amos/.local/bin/omp","platform":"darwin"}]`. OpenSSH uses the server user's keys and verified known_hosts with strict host-key checking. Files stay remote; Explorer is hidden until a remote file bridge is available. Session descriptors survive restarts and reconnect with the remote session file; no prompt is automatically resumed. The old `/remote` page redirects home.

## Architecture

ompweb is a Node-hosted Next.js app that drives your installed `omp` binary — it does not embed the agent:
- **Live sessions**: spawns `omp --mode rpc-ui` (NDJSON over stdio), one child process per active session, so the agent version is always exactly what you have installed. It negotiates RPC v2 when the installed OMP advertises it, uses bounded chunk reassembly for large frames, and falls back to v1 for older versions. Host env (`PORT`, `NEXT_*`, `NODE_ENV`) is stripped before spawn, and shutdown is graceful on both POSIX (process-group) and Windows (`taskkill /t`).
- **Live state and telemetry**: context usage, queue depth, compaction state, and tokens-per-second are polled from omp's `get_state` RPC and surfaced in the top bar and transcript; compaction cards show the maintenance method and before → after token counts. Subagent transcripts persist beside the parent session's artifacts and are recovered from disk so past runs still show their rosters.
- **Session browsing**: reads omp's session files (`~/.omp/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`) directly; title, archive, and delete are narrow native-file maintenance operations guarded against live OMP writes. Projects are grouped by a stable `projectKey` (Windows case-folded, symlink-resolved) so the sidebar doesn't jump between drives or worktrees.
- **Models and auth**: RPC commands against the omp child process with strict payload validation (unknown-shape guards, safe fallbacks); the Models panel edits `models.yml` in the omp agent directory, dropping blank placeholder rows and rejecting ambiguous `enabledModels` entries.
- **Native settings**: the General/MCP settings panels read and write the allow-listed subset of `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` (or `config.yaml` fallback), preserving unrelated keys and comments. Changes apply to new and restarted sessions.
- **Skills and plugins**: scans omp's skill directories (`~/.omp/agent/skills`, project `.omp/skills`, and compat dirs) and shells out to `omp plugin` for plugin management.
- **MCP servers**: project servers are managed through OMP's native locations (`.omp/mcp.json`, then compatibility files) at the git top level, validated against the stdio/http/sse schema and written atomically.
- **File access**: file browsing and preview are scoped to the selected project directory and working directories that appear in sessions; paths are canonicalized via a single `isWindowsAbsolutePath`/`samePath` helper and symlink escapes are rejected after `realpath` resolution. On Windows the directory picker offers a drive list at the root.
- **Forks vs in-session branches**: Fork creates a new `.jsonl` file. "Edit from here" creates another branch inside the same session file.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The local dev server runs at [http://127.0.0.1:30178](http://127.0.0.1:30178).

Common checks:

```bash
npm run typecheck      # type check
npm run lint           # ESLint (zero warnings enforced)
npm test               # run test suite
npm run build          # production build
```

Avoid running `next build` / `npm run build` during local development. It writes to `.next/` and can interfere with the dev server; leave builds for release work.

## Internationalization

ompweb supports English, Simplified Chinese (简体中文), and Japanese (日本語) with translated UI strings across all three languages. The language is auto-detected from `navigator.language` and can be switched at runtime via the language menu in the top bar. The choice persists across sessions.

- Dictionaries: `lib/i18n/locales/{en,zh-CN,ja}.json`
- Framework: `lib/i18n/index.tsx` — a lightweight store built on `useSyncExternalStore` with `{var}` interpolation and plural support (`.one`/`.other`)
- API error messages are translated via stable error codes (`errors.<code>`) looked up client-side

## Quality

- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant — Lighthouse a11y score 100/100, keyboard navigation throughout, focus-visible rings, ARIA roles
- **Performance**: memoized list components, RAF-gated scroll/mouse handlers, debounced search, streaming JSONL reader, ETag-cached session listing
- **Resilience**: graceful shutdown of spawned omp processes (process-group kill), error boundaries, atomic session file rewrites
- **Tests**: a focused suite covering session parsing, RPC frame chunking, subagent history, markdown rendering, message display, native settings, and MCP configuration — run with `npm test`
